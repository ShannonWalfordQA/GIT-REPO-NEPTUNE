Title:  Branching
Overview:

Branching is the term used to create branches within Git, often used to support testing and development of new features.

Description: 

Branching helps to developers to define workflows, making sure code is delivered in the best state possible, which minimises risks for errors$

Git allows developers to seperate codebases in to many different branches.

Branching allows for the isolation of developing and testing new features away from working code.

Branching normally involves two main types - develop and main. New application features are made in the feature  branch, and once successfully pulled, reviewed and tested, are then merged to the develop branch.

How-To:

To create a branch
   git branch [NEW_BRANCH_NAME]

To checkout branch
   git checkout [NEW_BRANCH_NAME]

To create and checkout new branch 
   git checkout -b [NEW_BRANCH_NAME]
